# Description

I'm always frustrated when...

- what are you trying to accomplish?
- what should be better?
- how would this affect your goal?

# Optional

- alternatives you've considered
- relevant screenshots
- requester status: user, developer
- version used (e.g. website, local copy at commit X)
- browser (e.g. Chrome 68, Firefox 61, Safari 11):
- OS (e.g. Windows 10, Ubuntu 18.04, Android 8.0, iOS 11.4.1):
- ideas how to implement the addition or change (consider creating a PULL REQUEST)
